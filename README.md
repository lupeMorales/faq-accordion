# FAQ accordion card

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution to the [FAQ Accordion card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam).
I would like to say that I enjoyed it very much.


## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge without using JavaScript
